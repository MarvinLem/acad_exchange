                    This site might be of interest to you.
                    Our goal is to build bridges between Cisco Networking Academies.</p>

                <p class="container__text">First, there is donation,
                    We have been visiting academies for some time and there is a gap between academies having enough equipment and academies in need.
                    Some academies often have some spare equipment that they do not use anymore. Some academies do not have enough equipment.
                    We intend to build a bridge between academies using this web platform.</p>

                <p class="container__text">Then, there is twinning
                    This part of the platform is not about donation, but about twinning. We all have ASCs, ITCs, but we don't have twinning. The idea is to bring together academies that will be able to build common labs across academies. Instead of building topologies in your own lab, you would be able to create common labs with academies from other parts of the world. The idea is to increase student satisfaction and increase their commitment.</p>
